  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>We have created software with one clear intent: to provide information to retail shop owners about how shoppers move around inside their stores so that they may arrange their store to facilitate the flow of traffic and place products in profitable locations within the store. While this vision is not meant to cause harm to any of the stakeholders involved, we recognize that this software could be applied to different context or have additional consequences we did not foresee. This page serves as our recognition of the potential ethical problems surrounding our software and describes how we expect it to be used.</p>

  <h1>Ethics of Video Recording</h1>
  <p>We feel that it is unethical to record someone without their consent; however, it is lawful in many U.S. states to record without consent. That said, the footage collected for this project is video that would have existed regardless of the use of our product because most stores have a security system that records the store. Recording for security purposes is common knowledge, thanks in part to signs like this:</p>
  <span style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
  <img src="./images/smile_on_camera.jpg" alt="Sign saying Smile, you're on camera!"
  style='vertical-align:middle;height:30rem;border:solid black;'>
  </span>
  <p>Given that people are generally aware of being recorded, we propose that signage be posted informing them of how security footage is further used in stores that use our product. This informs them that they are being recorded and to what extent that footage is used beyond what they already know. In this fashion, we feel we have sufficiently mitigated the ethical risks of using recorded footage of people whose consent is only implied.</p>

  <h1>Ethics of Recognition</h1>
  <p>First and foremost, our software does not intend to identify people or create personally identifiable information. Second, recognition softwares have historically encountered problems with diversity and inclusion because  they were published before their limitations were fully understood. As it stands now, our software carries all the limitations of the recognition dataset from which it was trained, and we have not yet characterized its ability to accurately recognize people who have darker skin, are wheelchair bound, or otherwise different in physical appearance to a camera. We plan to gather this information to prevent blind trust in our algorithm, but also recognize that our software may not have a wide enough impact for these limitations to become significant. Just in case, <b>this software has not been shown to inclusively recognize people with all physical appearances</b> and any application must recognize this limitation.</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>To summarize, we foresee risks relating to recording shoppers and recognizing people of all kinds in the application of our software. We recognize that there may be other consequences that we have not foreseen, but do not expect our software to be so widely applied that these miscomings cause widespread harm.</p>
